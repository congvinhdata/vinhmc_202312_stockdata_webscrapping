# Analyzing stock performance and building a dashboard
Hi guys, my name is Cong Vinh (call me Vinh) and in this project I would like to showcase my skill in extracting financial data from Yahoo Finance by different methods, which are using Python libraries and webscrapping on popular stocks. After the extracting and collecting step on this data, I will visualize it in a dashboard which can be used to identify patterns and trends for researching purposes. The stocks which I choose are Tesla and Gamestop.
